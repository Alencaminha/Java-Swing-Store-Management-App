# Java Swing Store Management App
## An application for managing the users and products in a store

---

The aim for this project was for me to have my first experience with Java by using the Swing GUI framework and MySQL
database.

PS: The project was written mainly in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE, but the Swing GUI Forms were not used, instead, all 
GUI components were handwritten.

PPS: The Mavem framework has been added to the project, still, no unit tests were developed for the current build.

The project is still a work in progress:

- [x] Create a GUI base with the Swing library/framework
- [x] Integrate the MySQL database into the project
- [x] Create the login page with authentication
- [x] Create the menu page
- [x] Create the manager's pages
- [x] Create the 'new sale' page
- [x] Create the 'search sale' page
- [ ] Create settings int the menu for the user to tweak
